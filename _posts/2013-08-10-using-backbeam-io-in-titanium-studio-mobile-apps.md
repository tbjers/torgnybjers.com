[Backbeam]({{ 'http://backbeam.io/' | bitly }}) provides a full-stack backend platform with API SDKs for Node.js/JavaScript, iOS, Android, and browsers. [Titanium™ Studio]({{ 'http://www.appcelerator.com/platform/titanium-studio/' | bitly }}) by Appcelerator<sup>®</sup> is a modern IDE for developers to rapidly build, test, package and publish cross platform, native mobile applications. We thought it was about time they met each other.

<!--more-->

In order to get started with Backbeam in Titanium™ you need only include the [Backbeam JavaScript SDK]({{ 'http://backbeam.io/documentation-javascript' | bitly }}) in your project and you are off to the races.

```javascript
Ti.include('/backbeam/hmac-sha1.js')
Ti.include('/backbeam/enc-base64.js')
var backbeam = require('/backbeam/backbeam')
```

Once included, backbeam can be called just as it would be called in a browser or in [node.js]({{ 'http://nodejs.org/' | bitly }}).

```javascript
backbeam.configure({
    project: 'your-project-name', // the subdomain of your project
    shared: 'your-shared-key',
    secret: 'your-secret-secret',
    env: 'dev' // can be 'dev' or 'pro'
})
```

Please see the documentation for respective product for more in-depth information.
