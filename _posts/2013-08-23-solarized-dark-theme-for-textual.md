After looking through the available themes for [Textual](https://xorcode.net/1azypgm), one of the best <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> clients for [Mac OS X](https://xorcode.net/1azyXCX), I decided to roll our own Solarized Dark theme by cloning the Sapientia theme packaged with Textual.

> Textual is a lightweight IRC client created specifically for Mac OS X.
> It was designed with simplicity in mind. Textual has taken the best of IRC and
> built it into a single client. Its easy-to-use functionality combined with
> scripting support makes it an ideal IRC client for novice to advanced users.

```sh
$ cd ~/Library/Containers/com.codeux.irc.textual/Data/Library/Application\ Support/Textual\ IRC/Styles/
