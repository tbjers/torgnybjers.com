After looking through the available themes for [Textual](http://xorcode.net/1azypgm), one of the best <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> clients for [Mac OS X](http://xorcode.net/1azyXCX), we decided to roll our own Solarized Dark theme by cloning the Sapientia theme packaged with Textual.

<!--more-->

> Textual is a lightweight IRC client created specifically for Mac OS X. It was designed with simplicity in mind. Textual has taken the best of IRC and built it into a single client. Its easy-to-use functionality combined with scripting support makes it an ideal IRC client for novice to advanced users.

## Installation

```sh
$ cd ~/Library/Containers/com.codeux.irc.textual/Data/Library/Application\ Support/Textual\ IRC/Styles/
$ git clone https://github.com/Xorcode/textual-solarized-dark.git
```

## Contribute
