Help determine your Apache `ServerLimit` and `MaxClients` for your specific server configuration to ensure that your instance runs smoothly.

<!--more-->

Oftentimes when we fire up a new AWS instance we use the *t1.micro* type. The default Apache configuration does not take the limited resources of this instance type into account. The *t1.micro* instances also come without a swap partition which may cause trouble once your instance run out of RAM. If you are running MySQL or memcached on the same server you will sooner or later notice that MySQL has stopped responding because the operating system killed it.

Use the following simple script to determine your Apache `ServerLimit` and `MaxClients`:

{% gist 4496984/check-apache-instances.sh %}

The script will output something similar to this:

{% gist 4496984/shell-output.txt %}

You would then modify your Apache configuration accordingly:

{% gist 4496984/httpd.conf %}

The above configuration excerpt assumes that you are using `mod_prefork` and that you want to keep some free RAM for other processes such as MySQL.
