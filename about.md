Torgny farms servers in the clouds and conjures confluent code from pixie dust and meteorite slag. If besought, he will help you find the castle with the princess. Logic, folklore, mythology, and nature influence his creations. Directly descended from a long line of proud Swedish Vikings he lends his keyboard to the Ottoman with the heaviest purse. His feline companion, Great Calamity Kitten Boots, accompanies him on quests of all magnitudes while his fantastic wife, Jill, rules the Realm of Scribes.
